This directory contains two sub-directories ./Main Library and ./Proof of Extensionality . 

The first one contains the files u0.v u1.v u2.v u3.v which are identical and each contains a copy of all the currently proved main theorems of the univalent foundations which only use one universe. It also contains files u01.v u12.v and u012.v where some constructions requiring two and three universes are presented. In particular u012.v contains the construction of set-quotients of types which at the moment is not effective due to the use of an axiom which simulatesd what in the future should be a re-sizing axiom of hProp.  The rest of the files in this directory are "experiments" of different kinds.

The second directory contains main files univ01.v and univ12.v. which are mostly identical. Each contains the formulation of the univalence axiom and the proof of functional extensionality from it. Due to the proof that functional extensionality for "straight" functions implies functional extensionality for dependent functions given in u*.v the proof now does not require three universe levels. There is also a proof that the univalence axiom follows from two simplier statements.
