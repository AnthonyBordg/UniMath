Rezk completion

Files used from V. Voevodsky's Foundations [1]:

  - uuu.vo
  - uu0.vo
  - hProp.vo
  - hSet.vo
  - funextfun.vo

They should be installed in the user-contrib/Foundations directory of coq, so
coq can find them.  The repository at [2], branch vv-master, installs them
there, but the repository at [1] has not been updated to do that.
