Univalent Mathematics
=====================

This coq library aims to formalize a substantial body of mathematics using the
univalent point of view.

## Contents

The "Packages" subdirectory contains the individual libraries of formalized mathematics. Please see the README in that subdirectory for more information about the contents.

## Usage

You can compile all of the packages at once. Make sure you have installed the right version of Coq (see section "Requirements").
After cloning the repository, change into the newly created directory and type call "make":

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UnivalentMathematics/Foundations.git
$ cd Foundations
$ make
```

You can have HTML documentation created by calling "make html"
```bash
$ make html
```

## Requirements

The right version of Coq is available from https://github.com/DanGrayson/coq 
TODO: specify right version (maybe v8.4-patched)
TODO: make the right version of Coq a git submodule
